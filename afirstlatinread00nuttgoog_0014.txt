the long summer vacation, it is very desirable that the
work oi the new school year be begun with a review
of forms and of the few last lessons ol the Primer ; other-
wise the opening lessons of the Reader will seem to the
pupil unusually difficult Even with this help, it may
prove in some cases that the first of the English-Latin
Exercises of the Reader require more than the usual
amount of study; il 80, thorough work should be done at
this point, even though the reading for a time outruns the
composition. Where more mature classes are using the
Primer and Reader together as texts lor a single year’s
work, it has been found that the Primer can be covered
easily at the rate oi a Lesson a day. Such classes will
naturally handle many of the Latin stories of the Reader
at sight ; and the composition work of that volume can be
reduced one third by omitting the last paragraph oi each
Exercise.
