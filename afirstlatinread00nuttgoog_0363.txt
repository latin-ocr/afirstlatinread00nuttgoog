128. A Successful Mamuver

When the light had now gone on⁸ tor six hours at' the
fortifications, our men would certainly¹⁰ have been de-
feated, if ¹¹¹ two centurions‚ men ol keen insight‚¹¹ had not ¹¹
run to Balbus, saying that a sudden¹³ sortie ought to be
made at once. Hearing this, and thinking that that ¹⁴ was
the sole ¹⁵ hope ol escape‚¹⁶ the commander gave orders to
his men that, when the signal ¹⁷ was given, they should
rush forth by all the gateS, and make a very lierce assault
upon the enemy. And so, when the signal was heard, the
'soldiers made a sudden sortie, and ¹⁸ gave the enemy no ¹⁸
opportunity to realize¹⁹ what was taking place,²⁰ but on
every side surrounded and killed ²¹ the inhabitants of that
region, who had come together with the greatest enthusiasm
from all the nearest²² mountains, hoping to get possession
ol ²³ our camp.
