Nona. With rare exceptione, the above rule holds good what·
ever the mood of the governing verb may be (for we often have,
for example, subjunctive dependent upon subjunctive). 1t is the
tense of the governing verb that is the decisive thing.

The following table illustrates the Law of Sequence of
Tenses as applied to clauses introduced by cum in the
causal sense:

Cum viri vocent, Since the
Ἴ men are calling, ego vocare notul do
Ξ Cum virt vocaverint, Since not care to call.
the men have called,

Cum viri vocarent, Since the
j men were calling, egevensnnutl au

⁹ Cum viri vocavissent, Since not care to call.

the men had called,

Nora r. While the general principle illustrated above accounts
equally well for the tense of the subjunctive in cumclauses and
in purpose clauses, it is well to note here, at the very outset, that
the force oi the present and imperfect subjunctive in purpose
clauses is somewhat peculiar. ln cumclauses (see above) the
present and imperfect subjunctive denote action contemporaneum
with that of the governing verb; but, since a purpose is some·
thing looked sarward to' (eg. venit, ut emeret, “ He came that he
might buy ''), the present and imperfect subjunctive in purpose
clauses necessarily have to do with action that is future from the
point of view of the governing verb.

Nora 2. The perfect and pluperfect tenses ol the subjunctive
(not employed in purpose clauses) designate an action 'as ante·
cedent to that of the governing verb ; see the second and fourth oi
the sentences in the table above. lf the forms of the perfect sub·
junctive are not thoroughly familiar, they should be reviewed at
this point.
