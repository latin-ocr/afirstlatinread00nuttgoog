RULE. Pnrpose may be expressed byn relative clause

Noun. Observe the similarity between utelauses of purpose
and relative clauses of purpose, noting particularly that, in both,
the tense of the subjunctive is determined in exactly the same way.

Rensun. In expressions of purpose, the relative is preferred
when the governing clause contains a more or less indefinite ex·
pression (eg. “a soldier‚” ‘⁴ arrows,” etc.) to serve as antecedent.
The relative construction should be written as often as possible,
until it is thoroughly familiar.
