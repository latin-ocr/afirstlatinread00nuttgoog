RULE. Parpase clauses containing tlte comparative of
an adjective ar adverb are introduced by quo ratlrer than

by ut

Nom. In purpose clauses os this last type, the comparative
regularly stands next to quo, as in the Model Sentence.

In regard to the use of the above forms for the expres-
sion oi purpose, the following points must be kept clearly

' in mind:

1. Negative purpose requires no.

a. Quo replaces ut when there is a comparative in the
purpose clause.

3. A relative pronoun is apt to be chosen when the gov-
erning clause contains a more or less indefinite expression
to serve as antecedent.
