208 FIRST LATIN READER

Thus, to choose the tense of the infinitive correctly in
indirect discourse, only one thing is necessary; namely, to
put one’s seli in the position ol the person who says, thinks,
or hears, and thus discover whether he regards something
as in progress (present infinitive), or as already accomplrhlred
(perfect infinitivo), or as yet to be (future infinitive).

MODEL SENTENCES

colonus dicit, The settler says

(1) nautam vocare, that the sailor is calling.

(2) nautam vocavisse, that the sailor lzas called.

(3) nautam vocaturum esse, that the sailor will call (is
going to call, etc). ,

colonus dixit, The settler said

(1) nautas vocari, that the sailors were being called.
(2) nautas verutos ease, that the sailors had been called.
(3) nautas vocatum iri, that the sailors would be called.

Rnnnnlr. Note that in the perfect passive and the future active
infinitives the participles agree with the accusative subject ; whereas
the verbal noun oi the future infinitivo passive suffers no change.

It is only when the governing verb of saying, thinking,
hearing, etc. is in a past tense that there is likely to be any
difficulty in determining how the subjectos that verb views
the action of the indirect discourse. Ii doubt arises in
such a case, recast the sentence in the Latin form, e.g.:

The soldier said

(1) that the sailors were on the way =

the sailors to be on the way (Iu PRooREss).
(2) that they had met the general =

them to have met the general (Acconrnrsrran)
(3) that they would arrive tired out =

them to be going to am've tired out (vna To ΒΕ).
