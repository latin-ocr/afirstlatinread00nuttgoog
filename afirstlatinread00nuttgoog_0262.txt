Noua 1. The plural milis, being a noun, is construed with the
genitive 3 eg. sex mllio nanterum, “six thousand sailors” (lit.
“six thousands os sailors”). Because the English idiom isso
different, this construction needs to be noted with special care.

Norn 2. In English we may say either “superior in number”
or “superior in numbers ” ,· but only the singular of numerus
should be used in rendering such phrases into Latin.

Nora 3. Fundamentally‚ porco signihes something like “be
mercilul,” hence its construction with the dati've case.
