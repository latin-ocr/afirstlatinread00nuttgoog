EXERCISE 1

I-STEMS

It will be recalled that third declension nouns fall into
two classes, (1) Consonant Stems, and (2) I·Stems. The
I·Stems include

a) Masculines and feminines in -is which have the same
number of syllables in the nominative and genitive
singular (ag. navis, gen. navis).

b) Feminines in es which have the same number of syl-

ι lables in the nominative and genitive singular (eg.
valles, gen. vallis)

c) Neuters in -e, ·al, and ar.

Furthermore‚ the plural of

d) Masculines and femininos terminating in -ns or rs, or
consisting of a single syllable ending in either -s
or ·x preceded by a consonant.

Nous. Memoriae the above statement just as it stands ; and
lind, iu the Vocabulary of this Exercise, a word which falls

under (a).

Reum 1. To become thoroughly familiar with the I·Stem
endings‚ it is necessary to write them frequently, even when op-
tional (ag. ·is for the accusative plural of masculinas and femininos).
And, in this connection, the inflection of I·Stem effectivas (ag.
omnis) must not be forgotten.

Reum a. As indicated in the Primer, the ablative singular
of masculine and feminine I·Stems varies too much to allow of
formulating a general rule. Of the words used in the Primer,
collis, bostis, nubea ovis, piscis, and vallea have -e in the ablative ;
avis has either -e or ·i; ignis and ulvis have either -i or -a ; and

aecllrls has -ἰ,
