RULE. Result may be cupressed by au utclause with its
verb in the present or imperfect suds'zurzctt've.

Nom. So far as form is concerned, the most important differ-
ence between result clauses and subjunctive purpose clauses is
that negative purpose requires the special introductory particle ’
ne, whereas negative result is marked in the ordinary way by non
(cf. the second of the Model Sentences above).

Resiluit. Some Roman writers employ‚ in result clauses, the
βαφεῖ subjunctive als0. This, however, isa special aud difficult
use, not to be attempted at the present stage of the work. Hence
the omission of that tense from the rule above given.
