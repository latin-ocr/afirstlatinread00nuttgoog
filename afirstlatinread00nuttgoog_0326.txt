Nora 1. Observe that the construction with impero is quite
like that with persuaded. On the other hand, its construction must
be contrasted very-sharply with that of iubeo, particularly as impero
and iubeo are so similar in meaning. Is, in translating into Latin,
impero is used always (and only) as the rendering for “give
orders,” there will be little danger either of missing the dative
with that verb (cf. the Rule in Exercise IX), or of becoming con·
fused concerning the familiar construction with iubeo.

Nors 2. On the deciension of Plinius and Vesuvius, see Note
a on the Vocabulary of Exereise VI.
