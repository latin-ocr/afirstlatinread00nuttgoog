even the horsemeu will surpass usin speed.⁸ 4. If we
should inform the general that five hundred and fifty men,
who were lately⁷ with uS, are now hurrying to the campos
the enemy’s armies, he would say that there are not enough
horsemen in Brundisium⁸ to capture⁹ so many deserters.

101. 1. Since wagons can travel ¹⁰ along this narrow way
very easily, we need not find some other ¹¹ method ¹² of bring-
ing ¹⁸ the grain. 2. If we proceed⁶from the plantation sev· ’
eral miles through the valleys, there will be a chance to hunt
andfish. 3 There are some people whom ¹⁴we hear are try-
ing to get possession of the money, so that they may have ¹⁶
more¹⁶ slaves. 4. Thus it happened¹⁷ that they were talking
about buildingssships. But we already have ten, andIthink
that the townspeople have been informed of the situation ¹⁹
and (that they)³ will send eight other vessels to reenforce us.

102. Τ lte Scout’s Escape

“Many years ago,”¹⁶ said the soldier to the consul's
sons, “ a ω scout set out from New York to joiu ²¹ our army ;
and,¹² as” he²² was a man of the greatest daring, he was
sent a few days later across the river, and remained¹⁴
several hours in the enemy’s camp. When he was ready
to return, he quietly withdrew to the woods during the
night,²⁶ but could not find the skiff which he had left on
the river. While he was thus at a loss,¹⁸ suddenly he
heard the barkingt of a dog, and fearing²⁸ that he would
be caught by the enemy, he at once advanced silently²⁹
into the water, and there³⁰ by chance found another skiff.
The dog, which had now come to the bank, swam after³¹
the skiff, and seized it with his³² teeth.³³ But the scout
killed the animal ³⁴ with his¹ dagger,³⁶ and returned shortly
in safety to our camp.'’
