Norr„ Quo is found only with verbs ol motion. Hence it is
only when “where '¹ is used loosely for ‘¹ whither ’¹ that it can be
rendered by quo; and, conversely, whenever “where ’¹ does stand
sor “whither,'’ it must be rendered by qu63 lor nbi cannot be
used with verbs os motion. Cf. the Note on hirc, p. 255.

In the same way, ‘¹ there '¹ as a rendering lor relative quo at the
beginning of a new sentence is loose for “thither.’' And even
“thithcr,” thus used, is not a real translation of quo itsclf, but
rather os the demonstrative adverb (eo) sor which quo stands3 sor
just as Latin, in beginning a new sentence, is prone to substitute a
. relative pronoun for a demonstrative (ag. quod eum fecisset, “when
he had done this ¹¹), in like manner a relative adverb is osten sub-
stituted ior a demonstrative adverb.
