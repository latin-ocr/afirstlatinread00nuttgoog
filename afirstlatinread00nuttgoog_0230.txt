TENSES OF THE INFlNlTIVE ΙΝ lNDIRECT DISCOURSE

Using νοω as a type, the six infinitives of a Latin verb

are as follows:
Acrrvrr Passrva

Present vocare vocari
Perfect vocavisse vocatus (a, um) esse
Future vocaturus (a, um) esse vocatum iri

Num The new forms in this list can, for the most part, be
learned very readily ; for the perfect infinitive active is found by
dropping the final -m of vocavissern the perfect passive is formed
by adding esse to vocatus, and the future active by adding esse to
vocaturus. The future passive infinitive is a peculiar and little·
used formation ; its first clement is the accusative of a verbal nour
of the same derivation as the perfect passive participle.

Of the three infinitives of deponent verbs, the future needs
to be made a subj'ect of special study. In Exercise II it was
pointed out that deponents have a future active participle3
and it now remains to note that, utilizing this participle, they
make a future infinitive that is active (not passive) in form.
Thus, the three infinitives of moror are: present, mutarn
perfect, moratus (a, um) esse; but future, moraturus (a,
um) esse.

With the verbs here cited as models form all the infin-
itives of habel, mitta, rapit, and audi6; also of polliceor,
proficiscor, patior, and adorior. Aside from f16,irregular
verbs call for little attention in this connection.
