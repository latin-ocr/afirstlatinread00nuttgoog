iv FIRST LATIN READER

attack a simple passage from Caesar or Nepos, not as a
Chinese puzzle by laborious effort to be tortured into some·
thing remotely resembling sense, but as a story from the
reading of which some pleasure and profit is to be derived.

For the development of a system of Latin-English
. exercises so graded as to serve the purpose for which the
Reader is made, of course no Latin author was available ;
and the text, therefore, is necessarily for the most part
original. With the idea of stimulating interest, and to
bring into play the necessary vocabulary and syntax while
yet meeting halfway the many who do “not care for (for-

deal almost entirely with matters of American history, the
initial series (1-45) summing up briefly and chronologically
the main events of the years 1492-1783, and the second
group (46—100) comprising short anecdotes assembled
without regard for chronological sequence. Next follow
two narratives from Caesar simplified (101-125), and the
concluding series (126-140) is made up of selections from
the original text of Caesar, Nepos, Suetonius, Sallust, and
Cicero. This final group, of course, is not a part of the
gradatim plan, but was added that the student might have
the satisfaction of reading some “real Latin.” The pas-
sage from Suetonius (131), chiefly because of its large
vocabulary, will probably be found too difficult ior most
pupils; if so, the intrinsic interest of the passage may
make it seem worth the teacher’s while to undertake a
translation for the class.

With aview to discouraging the habit of constant re-
course to the general vocabulary, a series of lesson prepa-
rations has been provided in the form of a word list
showing the important new words in each successive exer-
ciser moreover, with the exception of proper names and
