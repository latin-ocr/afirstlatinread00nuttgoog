EXERCISE XXXV 309

THE GERUNDIVE

The gerundive is an adjective, and-has two main uses:

1. Iu conusccron wrru the verb sum, the gerundive in·
dicates that a thing ought, necds, must, or should be done.
Intransitive verbs (impersonal in the passive) find here
the sole use for their single gerundive form, namely, the
nominative and accusative neuter in -um, ag. pugnandum
est, persuadendum esse, ete.

2. APART enon the verb sum (expressed or implied),
the gerundive of transitive verbs commonly lacks the no
tion “should'’ ‘⁴ ought‚” etc, being used with great ire·
quency in phrases which, in meaning and form, very
closely parallel the gerund constructions made by intran-
sitive verbs (or by transitive verbs used absolutely; cf. the
Remarl( in Exercise XXV). In these gerundive uses, too,
the dative figures so little that it is uot included in the
present discussion.
