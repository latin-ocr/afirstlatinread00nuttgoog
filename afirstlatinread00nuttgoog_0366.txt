130. Pompey’s Fate

After Pompey had been* defeated at Pharsalus, he fied
by ship ¹⁰ to Pelusium. There ¹¹ he found¹² that Ptolemy,
king¹⁸ of Egypt, was not far ¹⁴ away with an army. He
therefore sent messengers to urge the king to allow him ¹⁶
to go ¹⁶ to Alexandria for shelter.¹⁶ But as ¹⁷ Ptolemy was
a boy in years‚¹⁸ friends ¹⁹ of his ¹⁰ father were helping him
in the management of business;²¹⁴ and they‚²² fearing²⁸
that Pompey might²⁴ attempt to get possession of all²‘
Egypt, answered the messengers graciously,²⁸ but sent
baclr²7 with them two soldiers to kill Pompey. On the
arrival of these‚⁸ the defeated general was persuaded to
embark upon²⁸ a small ship to go²⁹ to the king; whereupon³⁰
he was promptly³¹ murdered by the soldiers. Had he
chosen⁸² to remain upon his own³³ ship, perhaps he would
have fought with Caesar again a few months later.
