THE GERUND IN PURPOSE CLAUSES

Verbs capable of takinga direct object are called Tran-
sitive; all others are Intransitive. ln Exercises XI and
XV it has been shown how the gerundive ol transitive
verbs is used ,in phrases governed by ad and causa to ex-
press purpose. Intransitive verbs, on the other hand, are
all practically defective in the gerundive, and cannot be
employed in these constructions; but the gerrnd of in-
transitives is freely used in very similar phrases,

Nora. Intransitive verbs are os two types: (ι) those which are
incapable oi taking an object of any kind, and (2) those which
are construed with some other case than the accusative. In·
transitives ol this latter type use even the gerund very sparingly
in purpose expressions (eg. veni ad senatui persuadendum, “I
have come to persuade the senate ”); generally they incline to
some other device (eg. an ut-clause).

Raulnv. In such a sentence as “We have come to buy,’' the
verb “buy'' chances to be used without an expressed object.
