thought to be British. We tear that sometimes men were
seized who were really* American citizens; but in those
days²⁹ the English were superior upon the water,⁸⁰ and the
Americanswere obliged to submit.³¹ But, afew years later,
war was declared upon the British; and the Americans, who
previously⁸² had had a very small fleet, now built³⁸ more
vessels, and often overcame the enemy even upon thesea.
