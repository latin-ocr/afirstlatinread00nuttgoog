EXERCISE XLII

(rar-123)
INDIRECT OBJECT WITH THE IMPERSONAL PASSIVE

It has previously been pointed out that intransitive verbs
are of two types, namely l 1) those which are incapable of
governing any case whatsoever, and (2) those which are
construed with some case other than the accusative; and,
further, it has been shown that all intransitive verbs are
necessarily restricted, in the passive, toan impersonal use
(ci. Exercise XXVI).

The passive oi intransitives oi the first type is already
familiar (ag. pugnetur, pugnatum est, etc). On the next
page is illustrated the corresponding passive oi certain

intransitives ol the other type.
