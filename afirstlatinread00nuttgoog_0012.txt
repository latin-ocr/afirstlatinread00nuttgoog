TO THE TEACHER

Fnon the present vigorous discussion touching methods
of Latin instruction it seems very clear that there is increas-
ing dissatisfaction with a course ol study which begins with
memorizing forms and numerous abstract rules, and ends
(for students who do not persevere beyond the Caesar year)
with a microscopic analysis of very limited portions of
Latin text. From the disciplinary point of vieW, even
such a course of study is, beyond doubt, profitable3 but it
seems likely that criticism will in no large measure be
disarmed, until more tangible results can be shown in the
matter of the student’s power to read tlte language.

In framing the Primer and Reader, therefore, the author
has endeavored to formulate a plan for ‘⁴ First Year Latin,'’
which, while retaining the chief merits of theold method,
will at the same time hold the pupil's interest, and lay the
foundation for a real power to read simple Latin at sight.
To meet successfully these additional requirements, two
things seem beyond all others essential, namely:

(1) To provide abundant easy reading matter, carefully
graded both in vocabulary and syntax; and

(2) To relieve the reading lessons of the dragging
weight of constant, minute, grammatical analysis

In conformity with these ideas, the Reader, as well as
the Primer, has been provided with a long gradatim series
of easy and interesting Latin stories which, as stated in
the Preface, are designed to be handled briskly in class,

with a minimum of grammatical comment. Adequate time
