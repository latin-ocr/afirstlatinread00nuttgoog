Pliny says that one day, when he¹⁸ was ¹⁹ yet²³ a young
man, his¹² mother suddenly noticed in the sky a black
cloud oi great extent.²¹ Pliny’s uncle¹² at that timer was
commander“ of a fleet; aud²⁶ when he ²⁵ was informed
that the cloud was rising²⁶ from Vesuvius,²² he boarded a
ship without delay, and set out for the other shore of the
bay²⁸ to save the farmers. When, however, he was ready
to return from there,²⁹ he could not set sail because of
adverse winds,⁸⁰ and never afterward³¹ saw his relatives.³²
For he died a few hours later ou the shore, although his ¹¹
companions escaped. Meanwhile, at horne, Pliny and his
mother were afraid⁸⁸ that even³⁴ they ³⁶ would be killed;
for the wind carried the ashes ⁸⁸ many miles across the bay.'
