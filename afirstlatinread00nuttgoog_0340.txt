The ollowing examples illustrate this use either of sul ⁴
or suus in clauses of each of the above types:

MODEL SENTENCES

1) coloni dicunt nautas sibi nocuisse, The settlers say
that the sailors have injured them (the settlers).

2) coloni rogant cur equi carros suos non secuti sint, The
settlers are asking why the horses have not followed their
(the settlers’) wagons.

3) Coloni nautas se sequi iubent, The settlers order the
sailors to follow them (the settlers).

4) Coloni nautas hortati sunt, ut llberos suos adiuvarent,
The settlers urged the sailors to help their {the settlers')
children.

5) Coloni timent ut nautae secum proficiscantur, The
settlers are afraid that the sailors will not set out with
them (the settlers).

The correct use of the third person reflexives is almost
entirely a matter oi memory; for the wording of au Eng-
lish sentence often gives no help. Thus we may say “The
king killed his son,” whether we are talking about the
king's son, or about the son of some one else. But in
rendering such a sentence into Latin, we are forced to a
decision: if the reference is to the king's son, the reflex-
ive adjective is the only modifier possible (Rex filium suum
interiecit); but if the son ol some one else is referred to,

the genitive of the personal pronoun is required (Rex eius
fllium interfecit).
