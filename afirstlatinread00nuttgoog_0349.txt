114. The Carrier Pzgeon

“Some nations use birds in a curious²¹ way in war·
iare,’'²² said the soldier to Marcus and Quin⁴us “ Once
in Europe, when there had been a fierce battle, and the
townspeople had been forced to fall back to their camp
with one of the captains very badlyn wounded‚ the leader
wished to find out whether the king was on the point of
coming to reeniorce him.²⁴ So ²⁶ he wrote a letter,²⁶ and
fastened²⁷ it t0²⁷ the f00t²⁸ oi a pigeon,²⁹ which had been
given to him²⁴ by the king. Set free³⁰ at night, the bird
returned home with all ³¹ speed; and the king, thus in-
formed of³² the battle, at once sent several companies to
the relief of his citizens.”
