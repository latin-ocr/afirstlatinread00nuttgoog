Rsuanu. It is very easy to apply thls rule to such a phrase as
pere militum, because the English expression so closely parallels
the latin. But examples like seuseudeciae,p1ue timoris,etc.,.
demand special study ς lor the idiomatis English renderings,
“enough boldness,'' “more fear,’' etc„ do not at all illuminate
the noun and dependentgem'tzhe ol the Latin construction.

MODEL SENTENCES

Sunt qul putent se non satis pecuniae habere, There are
people who think that they have not enough money.

Si erant quos curili timeret, Il there were any whom

llemo erlt quern audiatis, There will be no one whom

Runa. T he subjunctive is used ln relative clauses depend-
ent upon such general expressions of Extitence and Nullmst·
encc as eunt and nemo est (Subjunctiue os character-utic).

Nora. Observe that, when used as a general expression ol
existence, eunt requires no expressed subject; whereas, in the
corresponding English phrases, the indefinite subject cannot thus ’
be suppressed: eg. eunt qui signifies “there are mea wh0,”
“there are some who,” “there are those who,” etc.

Rauanu It is because the relative clause, in expressions ol
Ι this type, is felt to “characterize '' the subiect ol eunt, eet, etc..
that the name Relative Clause ol Characteristic has been devised
