viii FIRST LATIN READER

will thus remain for discussion of the material provided for
daily practice in composition, and here the teacher will find
a text for all neediul grammatical drill.

With the helps provided in the way of footnotes and Word
List‚ some classes will doubtless be able to handle many of
the Latin stories of the Reader without previous prepara-
tion; and, whenever this is the case, the practice should in
every way be encouraged; for a story always has added
charrn when taken up for the first time, especially if it be
not made the subject ol unnecessary grammatical discus-

of fact, it is really the most practical method of all. For
students who are required to write but once a week usu-

In working out the composition exercises of the Reader,
the pupil should be urged to use as little as possible the
general English-Latin vocabulary at the end of the vol·
ume. For frequent recourse to this source oi help there is
little excuse3 for, aside from numerals, proper names, and

to watch for, and curb, individual peculiaritics here and
there; but it will be found generally that this matter takes
