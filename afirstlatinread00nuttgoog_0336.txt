EXERCISE XXXVI 313

In the above, note that, even in the indirect form, the
interrogative word “why ’' is still retained-a fact that
shows instantly that we are dealing with a quoted question,
and not with a quoted statement. Consequently, even
though some verbs (eg. “to know '') are capable, on occa·
sion, of governing either construction, still the abseuce or

presence of an interrogative iu a given clause shows at ι

once whether or not that clause is an indirect question.

MODEL SENTENCES

quid legatus faciat.
Caesar audire vult what the captain is doing.
Caesar wants to know cur legatus abierit.

why the captain has gone.

ubi legatus esset.

Caesar me rogabat where the captain was.

[who had seen the captain.

RULE. The verb os an Inde'rect Question stands in tlte
subjunctive moed.

Noun. Observe that indirect Questions empioy all tenses os
the subjunctive, and with the same force as seen in causal cum-
clauses (Exercise VI). Watch with special care sor cases where
the Law of Sequence calls for the use of the perfect subjunctive.
