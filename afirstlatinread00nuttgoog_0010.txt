FIRST LATIN READER v

numerals, all words which are used in but a single lesson
are defined in the footnotes on that exercise. For teach·
ers who are using the Reader as a text for sight reading,
the cross references ol the notes may prove helpful as pro-
viding a means of locating familiar material with which
to elucidate the lesson of the day. Α
In preparing the Latin text, I have derived some help
from the handbooks in common use, but my main reliance
has been Merguet’s “ Lexikon zu den Schriften Cisarsss’
I would also acknowledge gratefully the generous help ol
my colleague, Dr. M. E. Deutsch‚ who has read a large
part ol the text and given me the benefit of several valuable

suggestions.
