THE GERUNDIVE

Remember that, in distinction from the gerund (verbal
noun), the gerundive is an adjective, ag. vocandus -a, um,
habendus, -a, -um‚ etc.; also that, in connection with forms
oi the verb sum, the gerundive indicates that a thing must,
orrglrt, should, or nceds to be done, e.g.: ⁴

Mulier vocanda est, The woman must be called.

Puto mulierem vocandam esse, Ι think that the woman
ought to be called.

Caesar sequendus est, Caesar should be followed.

Note particularly the last oi the above exampleS‚ observ·
ing that the gerundivo of a deponent has the regular passive
force. For the verb eo, see the Summary oi Forms, p.
374; and note that flu has no gerundive.

REMARK. Deponent verbs have peculiarities that demand very
caresul study. It has already been 'pointed out that for their
suture infinitivo they choose the uctz'ue lorm (ug. sortiturus esse) 3
and to this is now added the interesting observation that their
gerundive is passive in meaning as well as in form.
