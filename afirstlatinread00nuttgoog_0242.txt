SEQUENCE OF TENSES

:he constructions already familiar, the purpose clause
:learly illustrates a fundamental law running through
tin sentence-structure, namely, that the tense of the
rctive in subordinate clauses is influenced by the
of the verb of the governing clause. This funda-
l, principle is known as the Law of Sequente of
s It may be summarized as follows:

AE. lu dependent subjunctive clnttses, tlte present or
ttense is required wlzen tte verb os tlte governing
is o Present, Futurn or Ftnnre Perfert (Primary
nee),· tlte imperfect or pluperfect is required wlreu tlte
ftlte governing clause is nn Imperfect, Perfert, or Plu·
t( Secondury Sequente).
