N ona. Though, for the third person, Latin is much better sup-
plied than English with special reflexive forms, there are numer-
ous distinctions which even Latin cannot make. ThuS, when third
person reflexives stand in subordinate clauses of the types illus-
trated above, there is sometimes a possible ambiguity. In the
. sentence coloni dicunt nautas sibi nocuisse, sibi might conceivably
refer either to nautis (the subject ol its own clause), thus illus
trating the general rule3 or it might refer to coloni (the subject
os the governing clause), thereby illustrating the special use. In
cases of this sort, the context usually makes clear the meaning ol
the speaker or writer.

ψ Ruunnk 1. In this connection, it must not be forgotten that
the English forms “ himself,’' “ herself,” etc, are not by any means
always used as reflexive. Very osten they are intensive merely, i.e.
they simply emphasize a noun or pronoun (Latin ipse). Thus,

Rex se interfecit, “The king killed himsels,” but Rex ipse venit,
“The king himsey‘ came.’'

Rnnsm 2. For the first and second persons, Latin has no
special reflexive forms. Consequently all cases os ego and tn,
excepting the nominative, are forced into service as reflexives
(cg. Ego me terret, “I frighten myself ”); so also all forms of the
possessive adjectives meua, tuus, noster, and vester.
