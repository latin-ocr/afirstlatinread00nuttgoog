(61-63)
THE ABLATIVE WITH CERTAIN VERBS

MODEL SENTENCE

Hoc telo miles profecto non utetur, This weapon the
soldier surely will not use.

Rura. ittor, fruor, fungor, potior, and vescor gottern tlte
ablativa case.

Remmia. This list should be memorized as it stands, though
not all of the verbs are to be used immediately. As the Eng-
lish renderings are taken up, it will be found that they give little or
no clue to the Latin construction. Only constant vigilance, there·
fore, will insure against error in connection with the use of verbs of
this class.

VOCABULARY

exspecto, 1, wait for. reduco, 3, duxi, ductus,

’ Gallus, -i, M„ a Gaul ,· pl.‚ bring back, carry back,

tlte Gauls. withdraw (ag. troops).
ratus, -a‚ um, partic, think· utor, 3, usus snm, use.

ing,· construed with in-

direct discourse.

Nom. Ratus belongs to a small group of deponent perfect
participles used loosely with the force of presents. The rather
frequent occurrence. of these participles is doubtless one of the
reasons why the nominative forms of present participles are ern-
ployed so infrequently in Latin (cf. footnote 16 on Exercise III).
