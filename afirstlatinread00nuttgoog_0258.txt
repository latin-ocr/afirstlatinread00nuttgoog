MODEL SENTENCE

people (lit. the townspeople must be warned by me).

RULE. Witlz tlte gerundivo> and a farm of tlte verb sum,
Agcncy is expressed by the dative case.

Norn‘. When this construction occurs in indirect discourse,
and the agent is the same as the third person subject os a govern-
ing verb of saying, thinking, etc., the reflexive pronoun must be
used, ag. Nauta putat oppidanos sibi monendos esse, “The sailor
thinks that he ought to warn the townspeople.''

Rannnrt. From this point on, special care must be taken to
keep clear and distinct the three following constructions: (ι) the
ablative of Means, (2) the dative of Agency, and (3) the regular
Agency construction (namely, the ablative with a, ab).

MODEL SENTENCE

Per silvam ad castra adorienda veniebant, They were
coming through the woods to attack the camp.

Runa. Purpose may be expressed by a phrase made up
os ati and tlte accusative, with a gerundive madifier.

tences in which the verb of the governing clause expresses motion
(cf. the model sentence).
