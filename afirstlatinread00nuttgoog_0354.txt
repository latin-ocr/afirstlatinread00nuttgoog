120. A Cautious Lz'eutenant (Pan ll)

Sabinus was reluctant²³ to fight against²⁴ so large²⁶ an
army on unfavorable ground, Consequently²⁶ he for some
time¹⁷ kept within²⁸ his³ camp‚²⁸ hoping that the Gauls would
think that the Romans Ieared them. Finally, through the
help of aa Gaul who pretended³⁰ that he was a deserter,
the enemy were informed that Sabinus would soon break
camp, so as to fall back and go to the relief³¹ of Caesar.
Hearing³² this, and fearing that Sabinus might slip away³³
unobserved‚³⁴ the Gauls at once advanced³⁶ with great speed
toward³⁸ his camp. But when they arrived there³⁷ tired
out⁸⁸ with running, Sabinus by two gates suddenly sent out
all his men‚³⁹ who made so fierce an attack that very lew
οἱω the enemy escaped unscathed⁴¹ from the battlefield⁴²
into the town.
