superior in number, suddenly made a fierce attack upon
the companies. The centurionS, fearing that they ²⁶ would
have to fight οιι18 unfavorable ground, nevertheless ¹⁸ gave
orders to their men²⁶ to try to gain” a small hill not
iar away,2⁸ and to form in a circle¹⁰ there. When this⁸⁰
was done, the enemy repeatedly⁸1 attached every part⁸² oi
our line in vain ; ⁸⁸ for⁸⁴ each of our soldiers had made up
his m'ind ⁸⁵ either ⁸⁸ to die ⁸⁷ there or ⁸⁶ to be saved along with
all the rest.⁸⁸ So it happened that the horsemen, who were
coming in haste⁸⁹ over the mountain by rough⁴⁰ roads to
reenforce the companieS, suddenly attacked the enemy in
the rear‚⁴¹ and soon put them to flight⁴² with great loss.‘⁸
