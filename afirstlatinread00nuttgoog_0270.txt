LOCATIVE CASE—THE GERUNDIVE IN PURPOSE'
CLAUSES (continued)

In with the ablative is already familiar as the regular
method of expressing Place Where. City names, how-
ever, do nut follow this rule, but use, instead of in and'the
ablative, a special case form (Locative) which requires no
preposition. City names that are singulars oi the first or
second declensions have regularly, in the locative, the same
form as in the genitive singular.

MODEL SENTENCE

Saratogae et Eboraci Novi erant exercitus hostium, Armies
of the enemy were at (in) Saratoga and New York.

Remum< ι. ‘But a noun in -ium makes its locative in -ii,
Thus Londinium has the genitive LondinI, but locative Londinii.

Rnunrerc 2. For all other city names than singulars of the first
and second declensions, the locative is regularly identical in form
with th ablativa case ; ag. Athenis, “at Athens” (Athenae,
-irum, n), Carthfigina “at Carthage ’' (Carthago, inis, s).

Besides city names, three common nouns also form loc-
atives; namely, domi, “at home,” humi, “ on the ground,”
and ruri, “in the country.”

RULE. The names os cities, and tlte common nouns
domim, humus andrus designate Place Where by means
of tlte Locatz've case.

MODEL SENTENCE

waiting there to attach the forts, lit. with (tle. ior) the pur·
pose of attacking the forts.
