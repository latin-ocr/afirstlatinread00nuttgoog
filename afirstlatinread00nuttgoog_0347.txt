Nora 1. The noteworthy thing about the declension of the
I·Stem turris, is, os course, its accusative singular in -lrn Very
few common nouns have this ending ; but I·Stem names of cities
and rivers in -is regularly lor'm the accusative thus.

Neuter I·Stems with nominative in ·e follow the declension ol
mere 3 the others (with nominative in -al and -ar 3 see the state-
ment in Exercise Ι) conform to the inflection ol animal above.

Nora 2. The declension of masculine and feminine U-Stems
(ag. exercitus) has already been fully treated. How neuters
of this class are inflected is illustrated above in the declension of
cornia.
