MODEL SENTssNCE

Dum haec finnt. hostes subito cestre adorti sunt, While
this was happening‚ the enemy suddenly attached the
camp.

RULE. Dum (“ while ”) is used with tlte PRESENT indica·
tc'vc to describe a ecsr action that was in progress wticn
something clsc took place.

Nocn. It will be observed that dum with the present indica·
tive performs almost the same fonction as does eum with the irn-
perfect subjunctive. But there is a slight difference which must
be noted; e.g..·

cum in horto emm, laetus erem, “While Ι was iu the garden,
I was ha .”

Dum ἐξ domi flunt„ &eser oppinum hostium olplt, “While
this was happening at horne, Caesar took a town of the enemy.”

ln the lirst of the above sentences, the eum-clause indicates, not
time merely, but circumstance as well, ic. it implies that being in
the garden was the cause of the speaker's pleasant srame of
mind 3 in the other sentence, the dumclause shows that the
two events there mentioned were contemporaneous‚ but does not
necessarily hint at any other connection between them. Wetch
carelully sor opportunities to use the dumconstructiou.
