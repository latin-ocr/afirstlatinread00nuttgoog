RULE. A noun in tle ablative case, ‘with a modcflcr,
may bc used tc descgciatc ,α quality or characteristic cf a
person or tlcing.

N orn. It is osten impossible to detect any difference in mean·
ing between the genitive and the ablative of quality. But il the
modifier is pir, icor, or any adjective with nominative in ·is (as
similis), the ablative should always be written in preference to the
genitive. Thus, while we may say either maximae virtutis vir or ·
maximi virtute vir, the choiee ol case is at once limited if insignis
·is selected as the modifier, as in the Model Sentence above.
