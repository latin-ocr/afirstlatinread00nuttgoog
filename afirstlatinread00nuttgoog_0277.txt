conditions under which something is, was, or will be true.

’ Such conditional sentences are known as Simple.

Si nuntius pervenit, mllitem statim vocabo, If the mes·
senger has come, Ι will call the soldier at once.

Si caesar in castris est, impetos hostium vobis non
timendi sunt, If Caesar is in the camp, you need not fear
the assaults of the enemy. ·

which tell what would be true, if something slzould take
place. This type of conditional sentence is known as
Vague Future.
