THE INDlRECT OBJECT WITH CERTAIN VERBS

It is a lact already familiar that, in addition to an
accusative, verbs of giving, saying, and the like may
govern also a dative of the indirect object; ag. cenem
puero dat, “He is giving a dog to the boy.''

Somewhat different, however, is another important
class of verbs, which, while lacking a direct object, yet
govern¹ a dative of the indirect object. It happens, unt
fortunately, that verbs of this latter class are generally
most conveniently represented in English by expressions
that suggest the use of a direct object or oi some other sub·
stitute for the dative which the Latin words require ; and it
therefore becomes necessary to memorize a selected list of
these Latin verbs, and to lix lirmly in mind the lact that
they govern the dative case.

Rutu. credo, faveo, fido, ignosco, impero, invideo,
irascor, minor, noceo, opitulor, parco, pareo, persuadeo,
placeo, resisto, servio, and suscenset govern a dative of tlte
r'ndirec'toly'ect. ’

Nous. Taking these verbs in the above order, they may be
rendered conventionally: “trust‘' favor, confide, pardon, com·
ntand, envy, be angry, threaten, injure, aid, spare, obey, persuade,
please, resist, serve, be offended.” As intimated above, hardly
any ol these renderings suggest an indirect object, the reason

being (at least in great part) that they are not exact equivalents ’

ior the Latin verbs ; thus, nomo, which is commonly translated
“injure'' really signifies “be injurious,” “work injury,” or the
like.. meanings which obviously call sor the dative case. For the

⁵ When credi means “believe (a thing),” it takes a direct object.
