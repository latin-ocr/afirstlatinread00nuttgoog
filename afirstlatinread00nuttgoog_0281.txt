Clauses dependent upon verbs of Iearing look, at first
sight, very much like purpose clauses; but they differ
’ from them in important particulars. In the following
models, note especially the force of ut and ne.

MODEL SENTENCES

TImemus ut videant, We are afraid that they nnn! uon
looking.

Timebam ne quis veniret, I was afraid that some one wns
comIng.

RuLE. Verbs of Fean‘ng are construed with subjunctive
clauses introduced by ne (“ that '’) and ut (“ that not '’).

All tenses of the subjunctIve are found In clauses de·
pendent upon verbs oi Iearing, the choice being deter-
mined by the Law of Sequence as laid down in Exercise
VI. Used ln this construction, the present and imperfect
'subjunctiVe may refer either to action contemporaneum with
that of the governing verb, or to action future from the
point of view oi that verb; agas ⁴

I am afraid that he is boasting.
1 am afraid that he will boast
I was afraid that he was boasting.
1 was afraid that he would boast.

Timeo ne glorietur

timebamus gloriaretur

Nom. Observe that, in the phrases where the present and
imperfect subjunctive desIgnate action contemperamus with that
of the governIng verb, the soree os these tenses is the same as in
causal oum-clauses3 but when they refer to action that Is future
from the point of view of the governIng verb, the tense force is
like that seen in purpose clauses (cl. Note 1 on p. 220).
