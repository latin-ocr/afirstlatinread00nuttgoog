Runa. intransitive verbs which govem tlte dative retain⁴
thot case with their impersonal passive forms.

Nora. The chief difficulty enconntered in applying this Rule
is that our rather loose renderings, “ persuade,” “ spare,” and the
like (Exercise IX) incline usto forget that persuaded, parco, etc.,
are intransitive verbs, and, therefore, necessarily impersonol in the
passive. To avoid error here, constant vigilance will be required.

Romanu. When the impersonal passive takes the gerundive '
form (as in the second oi the Model Sentences), it is conceivable

that ambiguity might sometimes ause, the reader or hearer being ¹

left in doubt whether the accompanying dative is one of ogency
(Exercise ΧῙ), or whether it is an indireci object. As a matter
oi fact, however, the context usually makes the meaning clear.
